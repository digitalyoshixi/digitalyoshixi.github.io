This is a devlog about Winter Game Jam 2025

We built this game as a team of 6:
- [https://2635266513.itch.io/](https://2635266513.itch.io/)
- [https://github.com/the-kido](https://github.com/the-kido)
- [https://heptagonal.itch.io/](https://heptagonal.itch.io/)
- [https://amai-ichigo.itch.io/](https://amai-ichigo.itch.io/)
- [https://itch.io/profile/fever01](https://itch.io/profile/fever01)
- [https://yoshixi.itch.io/](https://yoshixi.itch.io/)

# Ideating
We built this during winter break after exams, there were a few ideas we had before setting down on our main idea.
We came up with most of these ideas before the theme of the gamejam was revealed.

There were a few requirements we had:
- Must be a 2D game - none of us had made any 3D games before
- Must be written in Godot, as we are most familiar with Godot.
- Must be finished within 12 days

### Into-the-breach style protect the flame turn based tactics
I had an idea for a roguelike game that involves players protecting a fire from a wave of aliens on a ice planet.
player controls units that have abilities to push, freeze, damage enemies similar to into-the breach.

There would be a shop system to allow unit upgrades or new units be purchased.

But, uh, this idea only realy makes sense if you've played into the breach.

### Freeze Tag
Game idea two is freeze tag, we make a multiplayer online game of freeze tag. Damn this sounds difficult.

### Ice-physics based platformer puzzle game
Lumiere thought about making a puzzle game with ice physics being integral to the physics. It seemed to be momentum based and with two options: to freeze and to move.

### Dont-starve roguelike game
Another idea we had was to make a survival top-down game that had gameplay similar to dont starve. Roam around the world during daytime collecting resources and try to survive the night near your bonfire.

### Metroidvania open world
This is a sidescroller metroidvania - similar to hyperlight drifter in gameplay and content.
Players move around a 2d world and backtrack to previous areas after ability unlock.
Admittedly, this was a larger project but it had the most room for creative experimentation of ideas.
![v1](/hackathons/winterjam2025/gameidea5.png)
There would be:
- Multiple biomes
- Multiple boss fights
- Unlockable abilities: dash, freeze
- Unique enemies
It was a large project, but we also had many people and 12 days to work on this. 

We had to setup the initial framework of the game, and a few placeholder worlds. 

But that was the hard part. After we had the map system and enemy systems setup, we could use object oriented programming to quickly add new content based off the templates.

# Minimum Viable Product
At a minimum:
- player movement
- player attack
- 2 enemies
- 1 boss
- 1 biome
- 1 ability unlock

# Progress
So, we had 12 days to build a project. We started by tracking everything inside a massive excalidraw document. 

This is that it looked like initially:

Sooner or later, this became too much to manage. Excalidraw has an upper limit on the amount of content that can be saved to the database, probably 5MB that was immediately used up by us drawing out the game world.
Its important to realize that the real purpose of a whiteboard is to ideate and brainstorm. Using it as any permanent storage for tasks is a bad idea.

So, we setup a trello to document game systems and todo lists.

# Gamejam Results
We played a bunch of games submitte during the jam to improve our 'karma'. Apparently 'karma' impacts how likely your game is to show up at the top of the jam list.
There were a few good ones that I played:
- [A heist game with ice physics](https://itch.io/jam/wgj25/rate/4163785)
- [A driving 3d game about plowing snow](https://itch.io/jam/wgj25/rate/4168073)
- [A ice archeology game](https://itch.io/jam/wgj25/rate/4164337)

We ended up ranking 14th place in total, which is ok considering it is one of our first gamejams.
