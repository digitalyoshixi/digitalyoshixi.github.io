This is a devlog about Touhou Jam 6, our very first gamejam!

We built this game as a team of 4:
- [https://yoshixi.itch.io/](https://yoshixi.itch.io/)
- [https://2635266513.itch.io/](https://2635266513.itch.io/)
- [https://heptagonal.itch.io/](https://heptagonal.itch.io/)
- [https://amai-ichigo.itch.io/](https://amai-ichigo.itch.io/)

You can play and rate the game here:

# Background
We are all touhou fans. lumiere and heptagonal play the games, me and amai are just fans. 
I've known about touhou gamejam from playing this dope ass sunflower game: https://noeticnightjar.itch.io/yuuka-souls

# Ideating
lumiere had the idea to setup the game to be revolved around Cirno collecting ice-cream while avoiding bullets from an angry Reimu.
heptagonal wanted to incorporate gameplay similar to papa's scooperia.

The gameplay loop was to be established as:
- Collect ingredients on the floor while running away from an angry
- Create ice creams to sell to customers

## Initial designs
This was the inital mockup lumiere drew:
![initial](/hackathons/touhoujam6/initialidea1.png)
There is a left safe zone that is a protected area from Reimu. You are able to create ice cream in this zone.

![initial](/hackathons/touhoujam6/initialidea2.png)
Upon entering the left zone, you are given this ice cream creation screen.

I workshopped an alternate layout for the initial screen that involved setting the workbench at the bottom of the screen, so that the game can be arranged more like a traditional bullet hell.

![initial](/hackathons/touhoujam6/initialidea3.png)
The main issue with this is that, most of the screen real-estate is not being used. 

So we scrapped this, and used the initial left-right full screen design.


## Day 0
In this day we:
- Developed a few assets
- Came up with game name
- Came up with excalidraw

### Assets
We drew a first tilemap for later use, we all had midterms to complete, so we decided it would be best to finish a portion of assets beforehand.

### Excalidraw
We setup an excalidraw instance to outline the project dependencies and the main gameplay items we want.

We decided against the scooping cream in our first image. Instead, we work with soft serve ice cream.

Initially, we thought of the ice-cream creation to be split into two screens.

The first screen involved adding the base cream and cone.

The second screen involved adding the specific toppings and doing a 'Cirno Perfect Freeze' at the end before submitting the order.

### Game Name
We had a few ideas:
- Unarguable Ice in Red Market
- Blue Baka Swirlaria
- Cirno Happening
- Cirnos Swirlaria

### Extra
I spent the week trying to learn FLStudio and composing for a touhou style game. Well, I didnt end up doing this since I know jack shit about music, but I learned a lot, especially from [This Video Series](https://invidious.yoshixi.net/watch?v=zJo90I4sNpg)

# Day 1
- Setup the basic ice-cream table making process
- Setup main menu page
- Setup main overworld

### overworld
This is the overworld portion developed by lumiere:

### Table Menu
I was in charge of setting up the table section. I setup a method to generate a cone, but the real trouble came in adding the cream.

I thought the most optimized method was to use particles. Godot's particle engine allows for 1M+ particles to be ran on the GPU, but the real issue is that particles cannot collide with eachother.

Well, anyways I used rigid bodies. There is no optimization to be had here. Anything will collisions must be ran on the CPU.

I also managed to setup a small ordering system.

# Day 2
- New assets
- Ordering competion
- Work on table
- Work on overworld
- Global states and signals 

### New Assets
heptagonal made new assets, they are pretty nice:

I took this screenshot of it being adapted to the ice-cream menu

### Global signal handlers and state
Global handlers were setup to keep track of:
- Cross-scene signals
- Game state (hp, points, orders)
We were able to use these to create a TV scene that kept track of HP and points

# Day 3
- New overworld with shooting and item collection
- New artist joins and helps 
- Line system

### New Overworld
Reimu can shoot now, and you can collect items

We adapted all the bullet patterns we wanted, except for one attack that involved reimu throwing a ying-yang ball. That one takes time...

### New art
Our 4th member helped to create some nice art for the story of our game

# Final Day
- Storyboarding
- Title page, game over page, end page
- Submission

### Final Assets
I tried to make a logo, and failed

### Storyboarding
We pieced together the entire story. Im not going to upload it here, play the game, its sweet.

### Submission
We did some final tweaks and bug fixes, and published **7 minutes** before the jam ended. It was stressful haha.
This is the picture of the final game we submitted:

# Cool Stuff
- There was another cirno game, it is about creating perfect ice blocks ( [https://itch.io/jam/touhou-jam-16/rate/3991138](https://itch.io/jam/touhou-jam-16/rate/3991138))
