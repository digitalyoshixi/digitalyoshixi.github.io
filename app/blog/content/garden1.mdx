My garden outside has been falling apart. Its not been maintained for 5-ish years. There is concrete on the grass, dead grass, dead vines, dead mice. There are holes everywhere that some creatures have taken over. Its just a pretty bad place.

As part of some passing obsession, I have been collecting seeds. I tried to plant some today, but realized that the entire place is overgrown.

We have to clear the entire garden of trash before actually planting stuff.

Here is a before and after comparrison, we tilled the place after clearing the grass and threw dry seeds inside.

I also dug up a golf ball. I think somebody was trying to plant a golf tree.

Now, im mapping out everything that will be in this garden, we have alot of stuff already that my mom told me to document. Were going to plant some more stuff - by around may 20th so that we are guaranteed to pass the last frost. It'd kind of suck if everything we grew shriveled up and froze.

This image was drawn with excalidraw. I have my own instance up self hosted on my site. *There are more services, that I am also in the process of setting up*.

I also have to remove that indestructable rock. I tried breaking it with my shovel, and my shovel head broke instead. Its actually hard as hell, it might have come from a metorite. Il have to crack it open with a pickaxe soon (**maybe there are gems**).

I'll be updating whatever goes on in this place in the garden section of this webpage.

Also, cherry blossoms started blooming, I took a picture before the leaves start falling (these things die REALLY FAST). You can use your imagination to fill in what is behind the black boxes.
