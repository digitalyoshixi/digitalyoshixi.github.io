---

These past few months, I have spent 200 dollars breaking expensive equipment and inhaling toxic fumes all to make an ergonomic split keyboard with as little cost as possible.

Turns out, there were a lot of things I did wrong, and to be honest I should have followed a full guide. But, perhaps my mistakes can be of use to anybody else looking to start this hobby.

Il go through my entire process of setting up my keyboard, along with all the mistakes I made along the way.

# 1. Determine The PCB

I went into this without a clear guide of what I wanted to make. I had this one thought - that it had to be cheap. 

Unfortunately, This lead me to first picking the ferris sweep - shown below:

For background, this is a reversible PCB (This means that the left-side and right-side of the keyboard can use the same PCB) that supports [Kailh Choc V1 Switches](https://chosfox.com/products/kailh-chocs), something that has a completely different build form than [MX Switches](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/k076mv/what_is_considered_a_mx_switch/)

Without knowing this, I proceeded to buy [Gateron Milky Yellows](https://milktooth.com/products/switches/milky-yellow-pro), which are of the MX build form. This mean I couldn't build anything lol.

I attempted to rectify this by printing another PCB, this time it was the [Beekeeb Gateron Low Profile Corne](https://github.com/beekeeb/crkbd-glp), which is of course, another switch type, it requires [Gateron Low Profile Switches](https://gateron.com/collections/low-profile-series)

Milky yellows are in fact not low profile, so I ended up wasting my money on that...

Total cost is ~$70 CAD right now. Really bad haha, but none of my parts were compatible and I still wanted to build something, so I decided to stick with the gateron low profile corne, and build on that PCB.

## Printing PCBs
PCB printing are very straightforwards.

1. Download https://github.com/beekeeb/crkbd-glp/blob/main/pcb/corne-glp.kicad_pcb
2. Open PCB in [Kicad](https://www.kicad.org/) and drill to gerber file
3. Go on [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com/) and purchase 4-layer consumer PCBs to print.

# Rest of Equipment
![Other Equipment](/blog/my-glp-build-log/otherequipment.jpg)
Beyond the PCB, I also have with me:
- USB 2.0, Micro-USB to USB-A **YOU NEED A USB 2.0 OR ABOVE FOR DATA-TRANSFER**

    USB 2.0 has a black inner-header. Anything that is USB 1, has a white inner-header.
    ![USB Colors](/blog/my-glp-build-log/usbcolors.png)
- Cheap ass soldering iron - general purpose
- Brass sponge
- Eyebrow tweezers (could not get proper tweezers)
- TRRS cable 
- Keycaps from [Amazon](https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B0DCBWMJF5?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title&th=1)
- Cutting pliers
- 2 x Arduino Pro Micros ATmega32U4 from [Keebio](https://keeb.io/products/pro-micro-usb-c-version-5v-16mhz-arduino-compatible-atmega32u4)
- 4 x Arduino Headers
- 2 x TRRS Jacks from [Keebio](https://keeb.io/products/trrs-jack-3-5mm)
- 60% lead solder because I love lead
