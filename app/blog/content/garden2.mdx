These past few months I have just been toiling away on work. 

I havent been paying much attention to the garden other than the occasional dumping of a massive tub of water on a innocent little flower.

Today I went to flip over a tomato that looked pretty ripe. I put my hand under it and was met with a thick layer of blight that started spreading throughout my skin.
It seeped into my veins and polluted my flesh until my hand rotted away into a mass of decay. I was really mad!

I checked on a few other plants aswell, the potatoes I'd burried were absolutely purple. They are supposed to be white, but they have some sort of disease I dont even know...

And there were berries. I didn't even know we had berries. I popped one in my mouth and it tasted so bad. It is probably just how wild berries tasted I guess.

I updated the garden to be more indicative of what it is now.
