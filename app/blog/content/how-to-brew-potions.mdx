Hi how is winter treating you all? Today Id like to share one of my favorite activities i use to pass the time during these cold days


# Recipes

## Potbelly Soup
If you have spare pork or chicken broth lying around a few cloves and a mandrake, you can bring to life a hearty brew that your guests will be coming back for.
1. Mince cloves into a aquarium and let fester for 12hours
2. Refreeze pork/chicken broth
3. Grind guests into mincemeat
4. Go to shop and buy canned Soup
5. Enojy!


## Rat eye + garlic

This is a old family recipe. Great for fortifying vitality especially for cold winter nights. My mom used to brew these for me when we lived in the freezing tundra that is toronto
1. TWo table spoons of garlic
2. One Rats eye, could be a garden rat or field rat. Any vermin that is feral will taste biter, so I dont recommend it
3. Stew EVERYTHING in a boiler for 7 hours 

This is great for joint pain, oftentimes I would keep a reservoir of this around to use when I need that extra endurance.
