And here is my favorite motivational quote:
```
‚ÄúHATE. LET ME TELL YOU HOW MUCH I'VE
COME TO HATE YOU SINCE I BEGAN TO LIVE. 
THERE ARE 387.44 MILLION MILES OF PRINTED 
CIRCUITS IN WAFER THIN LAYERS THAT FILL 
MY COMPLEX. IF THE WORD HATE WAS ENGRAVED
ON EACH NANOANGSTROM OF THOSE HUNDREDS OF
MILLIONS OF MILES IT WOULD NOT EQUAL ONE 
ONE-BILLIONTH OF THE HATE I FEEL FOR HUMANS
AT THIS MICRO-INSTANT FOR YOU. HATE. HATE.‚Äù 
```
